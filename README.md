# The Next Web

This is an assignment on The Odin Project. The assignment focused on Responsive Design and prompted us to remake "The Next Web" home page, including it's responsiveness.

I've heard many times about making a site Mobile First, and because this is an assignment regarding responsive design,
I decided to make this site mobile first (meaning the first iteration of this website was made to display well on mobile devices, and later iterations added break points to adjust the positioning and sizes of the pages components to fit well on larger screens).

This is the original [The Next Web homepage](https://thenextweb.com/).

My remake can be found [here](https://aznafro.github.io/tnw/).
